Dear dr. Harrison,
My name is Eric and my major is computer science. Since the time is I entered my Junior year, I have been having few problems related to the concepts, and I would like your help on that.
I love studying about the material from you in class and hence think that I might be able to get good advice from you. My interests lie in the following letting my mouth down; and I am hoping to further my learning experience. I would like some guidance from you.
I would highly appreciate if you can take out some time from your schedule and guide me regarding the following. Please let me know if you have the time, to schedule a meeting soon.
Iâ€™ll be waiting for your reply.
Best,
Eric
