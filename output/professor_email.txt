Dear dr. Harrison,
My name is Eric. I am a Junior, majoring in computer engineering. I wished to discuss some opportunities related to my major and I hoped to learn more from you. 
I had you for a class and your methods really helped me understand the concepts better. Hence, I wished to talk to you about the following issue. My interests lie in programming hackathon projects and. I hope to learn further in any of these fields, and require your advice regarding it. 
I would like to thank you for taking out some time and reading this email. Please let me know if you can spare some time in the coming weekends, so we can schedule a meeting and discuss about it. If yes, then what date and time works for you?
Iâ€™ll be waiting for your reply.
Sincerely,
Eric
